# 🌌 Parallax Website

This project is a responsive website with a **parallax effect**, created step by step.  
It demonstrates how to build a modern landing page with layered backgrounds (clouds, mountains, and a human figure) and a content section with placeholder text.

## 🚀 Features

- **Parallax section** with three layers (clouds, mountains, human).
- **Content section** with placeholder text ("lorem ipsum").
- **Responsive design** using media queries (320px, 600px, 1024px).
- **Google Font**: Nunito for clean typography.
- **Normalize.css** included for consistent cross-browser styling.
- Gradient overlay between parallax and content for smooth transition.
- Clear project structure, easy to customize.
